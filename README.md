I had a quick glance at React Native in 2018. A lot about mobile has changed, especially in react-native. I've decided to explore cross-platform mobile development with React Native and possibly Flutter. 

My reasons are to get a feel of mobile development, understand trends, how people use mobile and gain more knowledge on non-web environments. 

I'm beginning with a 30-days-of-react-native for the month of September. My goal for this month is to build a simple, open-source alarm clock in React Native. 

## Rules
- Show up for at least 2 hours everyday
- Document everyday's activities in this format
    1. Time spent
    2. Summary of yesterday
    3. Learnings
    4. Challenges
    5. Tomorrow's focus
